S'The Student Association is the University of Tulsa student government body. It is organized into three branches: the Executive Branch, which includes Cabinet and is in charge of organizing large campus wide events and activities; the Judicial Branch; and the Legislative Branch, or Student Senate, which coordinates funding, oversees student organizations, and addresses general issues impacting student life on campus. Its budget is provided partially by the university and partially by a fee paid by students each semester.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, the Student Association coordinates Homecoming activities, including cross campus competitions and the homecoming game tailgate. Another traditional event is Springfest, a week long series of events including food, various on campus activities, and a concert bringing in such names as Cake, Guster, and Ben Folds. Activities organized by Student Association are free to all TU students.\r\n\r\n'

His most recent project, Paydirt, is a response to lead contamination in post-Katrina New Orleans. \r\nMel Chin has received numerous awards and honors, including awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, and an honorary doctorate from Rhode Island School of Design.\r\nFor more information about these events call TU\xe2\x80\x99s School of Art at 918-631-2739.\r\n (Chapman Lecture Hall is located in Chapman Hall on E. 5th Street \xe2\x80\x93 from 11th Street turn North onto S.

Its budget is provided partially by the university and partially by a fee paid by students each semester.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, the Student Association coordinates Homecoming activities, including cross campus competitions and the homecoming game tailgate. Another traditional event is Springfest, a week long series of events including food, various on campus activities, and a concert bringing in such names as Cake, Guster, and Ben Folds.

S'Penny wars is a Mortarboard event to raise money for our national cause "reading is leading". To support this initiative we will be donating any money we raise to Reading Is Fundamental (RIF). Penny wars will be a competition between the "colleges" on campus. There will be cans for each college set up in the Caf, ACAC and hopefully in each college\'s advising office. You want to get as many pennies as possible in your can and put as many silver coins as possible in everyone else\'s can. The pennies are worth $0.01 and the silver are worth negative face value. It will take place next week between October 20-24.'

Its budget is provided partially by the university and partially by a fee paid by students each semester.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, the Student Association coordinates Homecoming activities, including cross campus competitions and the homecoming game tailgate. Another traditional event is Springfest, a week long series of events including food, various on campus activities, and a concert bringing in such names as Cake, Guster, and Ben Folds.
